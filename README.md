# Project_Breast_Cancer_Classification

# Project Overview

This project aims to enhance breast cancer detection through the application of deep learning models on histopathology images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning with pre-trained architectures like VGG19 and ResNet50, the project classifies breast cancer as benign or malignant. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis), which contains microscopic images of breast tissue.

The project demonstrates the importance of transfer learning in medical image analysis and provides insights into model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Key Features

Utilizes pre-trained CNN models (VGG19 and ResNet50) with transfer learning.

Implements a custom CNN architecture for comparison.

Uses data augmentation and class balancing techniques to address class imbalance in the dataset.

Evaluates models on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Achieves a test accuracy of up to 97% using ResNet50.
